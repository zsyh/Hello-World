# Hello-World
My first github repository
About 8 years ago, I started programming using Visual Basic.I made some simple winform applications,including a simple P2P IM based on socket,some datebase applications for companies and supermarkets.One year ago I turned to use .NET
I'm now a student of Dalian University of Technology,and nowadays the mobile internet developes quickly.Traditional PC applicitons looks to decrease.I started my transition, to keep up the curve of mobile internet.
